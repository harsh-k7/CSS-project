# 🌐 CSS-Project

Welcome to my **Basic Frontend Web Project** — a foundational step into the world of web development. This mini-site is built purely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, without any external libraries or frameworks — just raw code and logic!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as a practical showcase of the core frontend skills I’ve learned so far. It demonstrates layout design, responsive styling, image handling, and aesthetic structuring using only HTML and CSS.

> 🛠️ Built from scratch — no Bootstrap, no Tailwind, no JavaScript.

### 🎯 Purpose
- To solidify foundational knowledge in HTML & CSS.
- To explore real-world structure and styling of webpages.
- To begin my GitHub journey with a hands-on, visual project.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 💡 **Semantic HTML5**: Clean and accessible code structure.
- 🎨 **Custom CSS Styling**: Focused on layout, typography, and responsiveness.
- 🖼️ **Media Integration**: Image rendering and positioning tested.
- 🧱 **Box Model Mastery**: Practiced margin, padding, borders, and layout logic.
- 📱 **Beginner-Level Responsive Design** *(in progress)*
